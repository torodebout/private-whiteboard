# private whiteboard

a simple, private whiteboard, built this because I wanted a clean place to sketch ideas that saves automatically to my local machine, it uses [Tldraw](https://tldraw.com) for the canvas and a local sqlite DB to save my work, no tracking, no cloud sync, just you and your ideas,
